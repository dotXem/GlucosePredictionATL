This repository contains the source code of the "Adversarial Multi-Source Transfer Learning inHealthcare: Application to Glucose Prediction forDiabetic People" paper, by M. DE BOIS et al.

In particular, the PyTorch implementation of a FCN implementing the multi-source adversarial training methodology and the source-model weights can be found in:
* FCDAN: processing/models/fcn.py
* weights: processing/models/weights/
