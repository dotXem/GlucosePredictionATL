# Multi-Source Adversarial Transfer Learning in Glucose Prediction for Type-2 Diabetic Patients

This repository contains the source code of the "Multi-Source Adversarial Transfer Learning in Glucose Prediction for Type-2 Diabetic Patients", by M. DE BOIS et al., submitted to the ICASSP 2020 conference.

In particular, the PyTorch implementation of the DAFCN architecture and the source-model weights can be found in:
* FCDAN: models/DAFCN.py
* weights: models/weights/IDIAB_2_IDIAB/lambda0 for non-adversarial weights and models/weights/IDIAB_2_IDIAB/lambda017 for adversarial weights
